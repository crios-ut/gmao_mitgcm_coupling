Fahad's experiments are under "GEOS-5 Shared Experiments",
e.g., "GEOSMIT_GF25Pro".

For example, click on "Surface/2-D" under "AGCM Diagnostics", then
"CLIM", "June-July-August", "MERRA-2 Reanalysis", "GEOSMIT_GF1", and
"(z) Skin Temperature (Ocean)   vs   MERRA-2" to compare time-mean
SST difference with MERRA-2 for optimised (top panel), baseline
(middle panel), and closeness (bottom panel).  Colorbar units are
1/100K. Yellow-red shades in top two panels means warmer than MERRA-2
while green-blue shades means colder than MERRA-2.  In bottom
panel, green-blue shades means that optimized simulation is closer
MERRA-2 than baseline simulation while yellow-red shades means
that it is further away.
