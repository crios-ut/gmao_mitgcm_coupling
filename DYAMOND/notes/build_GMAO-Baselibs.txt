# Instructions for building GMAO-Baselibs, if it is not available

# For Lubuntu 16.04 and 18.04, first make sure that all
# needed packages are installed as per instructions in
# dimitris_notes/Lubuntu*_on_VirtualBox.txt

# GMAO-Baselibs-4_0_7.withNewCDO.tgz is available in
# engaging:/nobackup1/dmenemen/geos5/tarballs_100816
# discover:/discover/nobackup/dmenemen/geos5/tarballs_100816

# Note that Baselibs must remain in (or be linked to) location where
# it was built.  This is because netCDF libraries and LD paths are
# set by "nf_config --flibs" based on netCDF installation directory.
