- SFLUX: does it need to be included in surface forcing?
  Right now it is zero.

   The unit of SFLX specified in MIT_GEOS5PlugMod.F90 seem wrong.
   'SFLX',  'salt_flux_from_skin_to_ocean',          'N m-2',
   They probably should be g/m^2/s instead of N/m^2.

   SFLX exactly analagous to HFLX, but for the salt content. ie., the skin layer
   uses evap and precip and ice melt to update a "skin salinity".
   the gradient between that skin salinity and the upper level of the ocean salinity
   is what is used to compute the turbulent salinity flux from the skin layer into the
   top ocean layer.
   runoff is handled outside of this skin mechanism, and i know that there are
   thoughts about getting the sea ice melt out of there as well, but for now its
   there.

- QFLUX: why does it have anomalies near land?  Is it a masking and
  interpolation issue?  The anomalies appear to go away after aboout 1 week,
  so maybe initialization transients?

- First 4 time steps of SWHEAT (QSW.000007200[0-3].data) are zeros.
  See explanation and fix in notes.txt

- pickups for continuation, and pass the 2+2=4 test

- Make g5_modules more compatible among platforms
  by moving coupling parameters to instructions
  or set_mitgcm_env.sh

- Instructions for running on engaging

- Cleaner, more concise instructions

- Better testing

- Revisit whether -O1 is needed for GEOS_MoistGridComp.F90
  (the same compiler error seems to also happen when the
   compiler runs out of core memory on the virtual box)

- Work towards more flexible MITgcm tile decomposition.
  For example, "sNx=16,sNy=32" will work, but
  "sNx=32,sNy=16" will export distorted fields.

- llc90 and llc270 configurations

- runoff is missing in QFLX
  Will need to be specified separately in MITgcm or obtained from
  MIT_GEOS5PlugMod.F90 DISCHARGE (river_discharge_at_ocean_points).

- Handle enthalpy exchange:
  one other note: the enthalpy in mom is apparantly not impacted by the
  precip, its done in some other way that i don't know now.
  (jean michel, i have images of the "temperature of the rain" discussions
  with john and alistair..... cracks me up to remember....)

- Add dynamic/thermodynamics sea ice

- Code is not thread-safe, e.g., mythid is hard-coded to 1 in
  eeboot_minimal.F and in "CALL EXCH_UV_AGRID_3D_RL".
  Will we ever need to use thread-safe code for coupled set-up?

- c12_cs32_01 code crashes because of GEOS/MITgcm land mask inconsistency
  when "pLoad(i,j,bi,bj)=p%PS(iSLo+i,jSLo+j)" in import_state_fill_mod.FOR
  So pLoad is set to zero for time being.
  experiments/c12_cs32_01/matlab/looakt_AtmPload.m
  can be used to examine pLoad results.
